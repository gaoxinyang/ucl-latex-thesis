$\bs{y_{(1\times N)}}$ & The click result space\\
$w_{\text{b}(1\times D)}$ & The weights vector space of binary feature\\
$w_{\text{c}(1\times D)}$ & The weights vector space of counting feature\\
$T_{(M\times D)}$ & Transform Binary Feature to Counting Feature matrix\\
$A_{(N\times 1)}$ & Calculating frequency matrix which is an all-one vector $\vec{1 }$\\
$C_{(M\times D)}$ & Field  matrix which is a 0-1 matrix concatenated with \textsl{}{M} \\
& vectors \(V_{m,(m = 1...M)}\) and in each vector \(V_m\) only its \\
& corresponding positions in field \textsl{m} is filled with 1, \\
& with other positions 0. \\
$Diag$ & Transform the column vector into a diagonal matrix

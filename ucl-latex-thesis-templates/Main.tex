\RequirePackage[l2tabu, orthodox]{nag}


% ------ Main document class specification ------
% The draft option here prevents images being inserted,
%  and adds chunky black bars to boxes that are exceeding 
%  the page width (to show that they are).
% The oneside option can optionally be replaced by twoside if
%  you intend to print double-sided. Note that this is
%  *specifically permitted* by the UCL thesis formatting
%  guidelines.
%
% Valid options in terms of type are:
%  phd
%  mres
%  mphil

% Package configuration:
%  LaTeX uses "packages" to add extra commands and features.
%  There are quite a few useful ones, so we've put them in a 
%   separate file.
\input{MainPackages}

% Sets up links within your document, for e.g. contents page entries
%  and references, and also PDF metadata.
% You should edit this!
\input{LinksAndMetadata}

% And then some settings in separate files.
\input{FloatSettings} % For things like figures and tables
\input{BibSettings}   % For bibliographies

\nobibliography*
% This is a dumb trick that works with the bibentry package to let
%  you put bibliography entries whereever you like.
% I used this to put references to papers a chapter's work was 
%  published in at the end of that chapter.
% For more information, see: http://stefaanlippens.net/bibentry

% If you haven't finished making your full BibTex file yet, you
%  might find this useful -- it'll just replace all your
%  citations with little superscript notes.
% Uncomment to use.
%\renewcommand{\cite}[1]{\emph{\textsuperscript{[#1]}}}

% At last, content! Remember filenames are case-sensitive and 
%  *must not* include spaces.
\include{Preamble}
\include{Introduction}
\include{Chapter2}
\include{Chapter3}
\include{Chapter4}
\include{Chapter5}
\include{Chapter6}
\include{Chapter7}
\include{Conclusions}
\include{Appendices} 
% You could separate these out into different files if you have
%  particularly large appendices.

% This line manually adds the Bibliography to the table of contents.
% The fact that \include is the last thing before this ensures that it
% is on a clear page, and adding it like this means that it doesn't
% get a chapter or appendix number.
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}

% Actually generates your bibliography.
\bibliography{example}

% All done. \o/
